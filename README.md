## Current Main Project: 
### Project DROVER (Drone Rover Operations on Versatile Extra-hazardous Regions)
The primary objective of Project DROVER is to design, build, and fly a drone-rover hybrid prototype designed to enhance search and rescue operations capable of aerial and terrestrial navigation to locate and assist people in distress. This prototype will demonstrate the unique capability to land and drive when traversal via flying is not possible. Additionally, the vehicle will showcase the ability to execute turning maneuvers while airborne and land at an inclined angle. This hybrid vehicle holds the potential to revolutionize search and rescue operations by harnessing the energy efficiency of a rover combined with the agile air mobility of a drone. 
The unique dual-mode design of the DROVER opens a new wide range of possibilities for the utilization of technology to positively impact human lives. Its design is easily interchangeable to accommodate different possible versions (for example, to assist agriculture, military operations, search and rescue, and inspection of hazardous areas). 
This particular version will be focused on search and rescue operations, which often struggle with limited accessibility and time constraints. The DROVER will address these issues by providing quick and versatile navigation through both air and land. This version of DROVER targets emergency response units, including fire departments, search and rescue teams, and disaster relief organizations, aiming to improve their operational efficiency and effectiveness in challenging terrains.

## Research Experience
### Project ASTTRO (Astronomy Space Telescope Thermal Research and Optimization) (_November 2023 - August 2024_)
**SPACE Lab - Dr. do Vale Pereira**

The project's main objective is to propose a design for a large observatory that will orbit around Earth in a highly eccentric orbit with an apoapsis close to the lunar orbit. My role was more focused on the thermal aspects of the telescope; Calculating the effects of the thermal environment on the telescope structure, with more emphasis on the mirrors to check for survivability and optical stability in given conditions. 
Engaging in research has proven to be an exceptional experience. The practical application of knowledge acquired from lectures and laboratories has made me aware of the importance of details and how vital interconnections between different subjects are in engineering projects, highlighting the importance of teamwork in developing a high-quality project.

### RedHouse Project – Dr. Andrew Palmer Laboratory (_September 2021 – May 2022_)
I have volunteered in Dr. Andrew Palmer’s “Red House”, a greenhouse where I tended to tomato plants grown in conditions that emulated the ones humans would have to face while farming on Mars; the experiment was so successful that Heinz Tomato Ketchup created a limited run of prototype [bottles “Marz Edition”](https://news.fit.edu/academics-research/heinz-marz-edition-ketchup-made-possible-by-florida-tech-science/) from the crops.

## Workforce Developments & Summer Schools
### NASA Mission Concept Academy (_Jan 2024 – May 2024_)
Served as **Deputy Project Manager** in a NASA workforce development program focused on mastering exploration mission protocols and industry practices led by NASA professionals. Collaborated with a team to apply professional practices and procedures, enhancing project management skills and understanding of NASA's exploration processes

•	Deliverables: Team Organizational Chart, MCR, SRR, MDR, PDR, PDR Presentation

### ESA/EGRA Gravity-related Research Summer School – ESEC-Galaxia, Belgium (_June 2023_)
In June 2023, I was selected to be part of the ESA/ELGRA Gravity-Related Summer School, where I got to fly to Belgium and experience a blended format of lectures, workshops, and team activities on altered-gravity experiments. Learning from experts affiliated with ESA and ELGRA, who freely shared their expertise in biology, human physiology, physics, and engineering, has been truly enriching. However, the most rewarding experience has been encountering an incredibly diverse and talented group of young students from universities all over Europe, creating a stimulating and supportive environment. As part of completing the Summer School, we were divided into groups to complete a multidisciplinary team project. The teams were structured to feature completely different backgrounds: engineers, biologists, neuroscientists, and doctors, all from different countries. Diving into unfamiliar subjects made the project challenging; for example, our project consisted of testing human’s attentional load in altered gravity, which focused mostly on neuroscience, something quite different from engineering. It was incredibly gratifying to see how different branches of STEM subjects intertwine and are necessary to one another and how we managed to each use our skills and different backgrounds to achieve a successful experiment.

## Others
### Mars Plant Challenge (_Fall 2021 - Spring 2022_)
Although my studies are more focused on airplanes and rockets, I am aware of the importance of all STEM subjects to space exploration. At Florida Tech, I have been very active in the Astrobiological Research and Education Society (ARES), where I have been part of a team of undergraduate students who managed to grow Oyster mushrooms in simulant Martian regolith, with the main objective to understand how to feed a crew in space, maximize resources, and forward all research to NASA’s lunar program Artemis. The team, the “Florida Tech Fungis”, won “Best Plant Growth”, “Most Innovative Experiment”, and “Best Evaluation Results” prizes in the professional division of the competition.

### Freshman Design Project (_Spring 2022_)
The purpose of this project was to design and build a glider. The requirements included size  (4 ft x 4 ft x 1 ft) and total mass (4.41lb) constraints. A payload bay had to be included for the accommodation of a small object of 43g (included in the total mass of the glider) and size 4 in x 3 in x 5 in. The glider could not include pre-shaped components from any kit, batteries, electronic motors, or any energy source. The materials allowed for the realization of the glider were balsa wood sheets, 3D printing wire, dowel rods, and Expanded Polystyrene Foam. The total budget of the project couldn’t exceed $50.
