## Senior Design Project 
### Project DROVER (Drone Rover Operations on Versatile Extra-hazardous Regions)
![DROVER](Pictures/DROVER%20Patch.png)
The primary objective of Project DROVER is to design, build, and fly a drone-rover hybrid prototype designed to enhance search and rescue operations capable of aerial and terrestrial navigation to locate and assist people in distress. This prototype will demonstrate the unique capability to land and drive when traversal via flying is not possible. Additionally, the vehicle will showcase the ability to execute turning maneuvers while airborne and land at an inclined angle. This hybrid vehicle holds the potential to revolutionize search and rescue operations by harnessing the energy efficiency of a rover combined with the agile air mobility of a drone. 
The unique dual-mode design of the DROVER opens a new wide range of possibilities for the utilization of technology to positively impact human lives. Its design is easily interchangeable to accommodate different possible versions (for example, to assist agriculture, military operations, search and rescue, and inspection of hazardous areas). 
This particular version will be focused on search and rescue operations, which often struggle with limited accessibility and time constraints. The DROVER will address these issues by providing quick and versatile navigation through both air and land. This version of DROVER targets emergency response units, including fire departments, search and rescue teams, and disaster relief organizations, aiming to improve their operational efficiency and effectiveness in challenging terrains. 

There are some important features to mention that help DROVER with the mission:

 • _FPV Camera & IR Camera_: the first is the eyes of the pilot and helps navigating DROVER as well as locating the potential victims, the second is to help pilot and DROVER locating potential rescuees trapped under rubble or debris.
 
 • _Microphone & Speaker_: DROVER is equipped with microphone and speaker to be able to engage in a two-way communication with the potential person in distress.
 
 • _Payload_: on the back of DROVER is possible to attach a small payload up to 600g, this is to manage to transport items like a 0.5L water bottle, medication, food, etc.

DROVER can be considered an overall success, as all its objectives were achieved!
These are some testing examples DROVER underwent:

 • Tested live video feed of FPV camera and IR camera during operations. 
 
 • Established 2-way verbal communication. 
 
 • Tested flying and driving capabilities of the prototype independently and combined.
 
 • Completed obstacle course with 600g payload, featuring 20° inclines and diverse terrains. 
 
 • Implemented automatic landing failsafe in case of controller signal lost and low system battery. 
 
 • Conducted endurance test resulting in a 15-minute hover time.

## Research Experience
### Project ASTTRO (Astronomy Space Telescope Thermal Research and Optimization) (_November 2023 - August 2024_)
**SPACE Lab - Dr. do Vale Pereira**

The project's main objective is to propose a design for a large observatory that will orbit around Earth in a highly eccentric orbit with an apoapsis close to the lunar orbit. My role was more focused on the thermal aspects of the telescope; Calculating the effects of the thermal environment on the telescope structure, with more emphasis on the mirrors to check for survivability and optical stability in given conditions. 
Engaging in research has proven to be an exceptional experience. The practical application of knowledge acquired from lectures and laboratories has made me aware of the importance of details and how vital interconnections between different subjects are in engineering projects, highlighting the importance of teamwork in developing a high-quality project.

### RedHouse Project – Dr. Andrew Palmer Laboratory (_September 2021 – May 2022_)
I have volunteered in Dr. Andrew Palmer’s “Red House”, a greenhouse where I tended to tomato plants grown in conditions that emulated the ones humans would have to face while farming on Mars; the experiment was so successful that Heinz Tomato Ketchup created a limited run of prototype [bottles “Marz Edition”](https://news.fit.edu/academics-research/heinz-marz-edition-ketchup-made-possible-by-florida-tech-science/) from the crops.

## Grad School Projects
### Computational: Applied Planning & Optimization
For my Applied Planning and Optmization class I developed (using Python) a path-planning algorithm that uses A* in order to find the safest path in terms of elevation for martian rovers. In this project I integrated real NASA elevation data by analyzing an orbiter picture of the Jezero crater. The steeper and higher, the more dangerous it is to traverse for the rover, and therefore, the higher the cost will be. I utilized the library "rasterio", which manipulated the image to get the elevation, and then created the figures using the classic "matplotlib". The code runs two different A* applications, a “standard” one, which only accounts for the distance, and a “terrain-aware” one, which implements the terrain-aware cost. 

I have a dedicated page where you can see my full project write up, including Google Colab link for the algorithm, and output figures:

### ESA/EGRA Gravity-related Research Summer School – ESEC-Galaxia, Belgium (_June 2023_)
In June 2023, I was selected to be part of the ESA/ELGRA Gravity-Related Summer School, where I got to fly to Belgium and experience a blended format of lectures, workshops, and team activities on altered-gravity experiments. Learning from experts affiliated with ESA and ELGRA, who freely shared their expertise in biology, human physiology, physics, and engineering, has been truly enriching. However, the most rewarding experience has been encountering an incredibly diverse and talented group of young students from universities all over Europe, creating a stimulating and supportive environment. As part of completing the Summer School, we were divided into groups to complete a multidisciplinary team project. The teams were structured to feature completely different backgrounds: engineers, biologists, neuroscientists, and doctors, all from different countries. Diving into unfamiliar subjects made the project challenging; for example, our project consisted of testing human’s attentional load in altered gravity, which focused mostly on neuroscience, something quite different from engineering. It was incredibly gratifying to see how different branches of STEM subjects intertwine and are necessary to one another and how we managed to each use our skills and different backgrounds to achieve a successful experiment.

## Undergrad Projects

### Computational Projects

### Space Vehicle Control Class - Final Project (_Fall 2024_)
The objective of this project was to design the Attitude Determination and the Control System of a space vehicle simulating the Early Orbit Phase of a Medium Earth Orbit. The space vehicle had to detumble within its first ten orbits, and its angular velocity (𝜔) had to reduce to less than 0.2 RPMs. Once de-tumbled, the space vehicle had to rotate so that its −𝑏3 vector pointed to the center of the Earth for better communications. Finally, the space vehicle also had to align its 𝑏 2 vector with the velocity vector.  The only components available for the project were up to three Magnetorquers (MTQ) with a maximum of 500 mA each, up to five Reaction Wheels (RW), and three sensors: a magnetometer, a sun sensor, and a gyro.
